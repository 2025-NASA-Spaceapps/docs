NASA DATA & RESOURCES

Plankton Aerosols Clouds and Ecosystems (PACE) data for phytoplankton abundance and community composition: The PACE satellite launched in February 2024. It provides unprecedented coverage for phytoplankton community compositions.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua data for phytoplankton abundance: MODIS-Aqua has been flying for just over two decades, and provides an excellent time series with which to compare trends.

Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) data for eddy tracking: Observations from SWOT can be used to better understand ocean currents and processes happening at spatial scales on the order of 15-150 km, something that had not been done before. SWOT enables high-resolution (within one km from land) monitoring of coastal regions, including coastal currents, storm surges, and regional sea level change.
